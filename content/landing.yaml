    have come together under a common set of principles to think creatively about 
    access to faculty publications and the sustainability of journal 
    subscriptions. The Texas Library Coalition for United Action (TLCUA) has 
    organized to identify the best way to change current models and the 
    relationships between academic institutions and publishers. Our goals are 
    ambitious â€“ improved access to scholarship, greater control over faculty 
    content, and pricing models that are sustainable for strained library budgets 
    in higher education. TLCUA has begun its mission by entering into dialog with 
    academic publisher Elsevier. We hope that through positive engagement and 
    mutual understanding, an improved and sustainable model for the dissemination 
    of scholarship can be achieved.
